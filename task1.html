             <h2>CHAPTER1</h2>   
             There are two scenes within this first chapter. Here’s a quick summary of each scene before we look at the high-level analysis:

             Scene 1: Vernon Dursley hears and sees strange things on the way to work—a cat reading a map, people dressed in ridiculous cloaks, and even a mention of “The Potters” and 
             “their son Harry.” This stresses him out, but he remains focused on going to work and selling drills. Later, when Vernon gets home from work, he hears an unusual news report that talks about
              shooting stars and owls flying all over the place during the day. Rather than worry his wife, Petunia, Vernon keeps his observations and fears to himself. He falls asleep feeling confident that even if the Potters are involved in all this nonsense, there is no reason for them to bother him and his family.
             
             Scene 2: Later that night, Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, meets Professor McGonagall outside of the Dursley’s home. He confirms that all the rumors 
             about Voldemort are true—Voldemort killed Lily and James Potter, and then disappeared after he failed to kill their son, Harry. And not only that, but Voldemort’s powers seem to be gone or broken, as well. Dumbledore 
             tells McGonagall that Hagrid will be arriving soon, with baby Harry in tow. When McGonagall learns that Dumbledore plans to leave baby Harry with the Dursleys, she begs him to reconsider. But Dumbledore believes this is the best place for Harry to grow up, so the three adults deposit Harry on the Dursley’s doorstep and wish for the best.

      <h2>CHAPTER2</h2>
      Ten years have passed. Harry is now almost eleven and living in wretchedness in a cupboard under the stairs in the Dursley house.
      He is tormented by the Dursleys’ son, Dudley, a spoiled and whiny boy. Harry is awakened one morning by his aunt, Petunia, telling him to tend 
      to the bacon immediately, because it is Dudley’s birthday and everything must be perfect. Dudley gets upset because he has only thirty-seven presents, one fewer than the previous year.
       When a neighbor calls to say she will not be able to watch Harry for the day, Dudley begins to cry, as he is upset that Harry will have to be brought along on Dudley’s birthday trip to the zoo. 
       At the zoo, the Dursleys spoil Dudley and his friend Piers, neglecting Harry as usual. In the reptile house, Harry pays close attention to a boa constrictor and is astonished when he is able to have a conversation with it. 
       Noticing what Harry is doing, Piers calls over Mr. Dursley and Dudley, who pushes Harry aside to get a better look at the snake. At this moment, the glass front of the snake’s tank vanishes and the boa constrictor slithers out onto the floor.
        Dudley and Piers claim that the snake attacked them. The Dursleys are in shock. At home, Harry is punished for the snake incident, being sent to his cupboard without any food, though he feels he had nothing to do with what happened.

            <h2> CHAPTER3</h2>
            Punished for the boa constrictor incident, Harry is locked in his cupboard until summer. When finally free, he spends most of the time outside his house to escape the torments of Dudley’s cohorts. 
            Harry is excited by the prospect of starting a new school in the fall, far away from Dudley for the first time in his life. One day, Uncle Vernon tells Harry to fetch the mail. 
            Harry notices a letter bearing a coat of arms that is addressed to him in “The Cupboard under the Stairs.” Uncle Vernon grabs the envelope from him and shows it to his wife. Both are shocked. They force Dudley and Harry to leave the kitchen in order to discuss what to do. The next day, Uncle Vernon visits Harry in the cupboard. 
            He refuses to discuss the letter, but he tells Harry to move into Dudley’s second room, previously used to store Dudley’s toys.
            The next day, another letter comes for Harry, this time addressed to him in “The Smallest Bedroom.” Uncle Vernon becomes alarmed.
             Harry tries to get the letter, but Uncle Vernon keeps it from him. The following morning, Harry wakes up early to try to get the mail before anyone gets up, but he is thwarted by Uncle Vernon, 
             who has slept near the mail slot waiting for the letters. Though Uncle Vernon nails the mail slot shut, twelve letters come for Harry the next day, slipped under the door or through the cracks. Soon letters flood the house, entering in impossible ways. 
             Uncle Vernon continues to prevent Harry from reading any of them. Enraged, Uncle Vernon decides to take everyone away from the house, but at the hotel where they stay, a hundred letters are delivered for Harry. Uncle Vernon decides on even greater isolation. On a dark, stormy night,
              he takes the family out to an island with only one shack on it. Inside, Vernon bolts the door. At midnight, as it becomes Harry’s birthday, there is a loud thump at the door.
